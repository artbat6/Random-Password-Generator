# Random Password Generator

The user enters a desired password length and is prompted for what character types to include. These prompts are validated so that at least one character type is chosen and then a password is created that matches the criteria. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
